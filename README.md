# OnboardingAutomation
An end-to-end automation created using SharePoint and Power Platform. This was initially created for BAT Aspac Service Centre Sdn. Bhd.. Most of the work has been redacted and generalised to adhere by the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the organization. Asad worked on this using Power Platform to enhance a guided form. He also added in automations that help the small team offload repetitive processes.
